##
# Graphenelib module contains several classes used in creating, manipulating and
# analyzing graph networks in Ruby.
#
# All the Classes are written in Ruby with no C or other language dependencies.
#
# The following classes are currently available
# * Graph - Base Class for all other Classes
#
# This module can be considered a POC currently as I haven't spent any time
# optimizing this library for really large graphs.
