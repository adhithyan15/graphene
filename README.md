# Graphene
A small graph library for Ruby. Extracted from my Cinchcli project. **A work in progress!**

## Why another graph library?
I needed a graph library to build a graph representation of option and argument hierarchy in my Cinchcli project. I looked around to 
see if I can find a small graph library written in pure Ruby. I found some. But the documentation was awful. So I decided to build a small library myself with full documentation. 

## Inspiration
This library will be structured based on the following libraries

* NetworkX - Python
* Boost Graph Library - C++
